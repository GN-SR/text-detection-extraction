# Text Detection and Extraction using OpenCV and OCR

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV and Tesseract-OCR to detect and extract text from images. OpenCV is utilized for image processing tasks such as converting the image to grayscale, applying thresholding, and finding contours. Tesseract-OCR is then employed to recognize and extract text from the processed image. The extracted text is saved to a file for further use.

## About

This project uses OpenCV and Tesseract-OCR to detect and extract text from images. It processes images to identify text regions, extracts the text, and saves it to a file. This tool is useful for digitizing printed documents and extracting information from images efficiently.

## Required Installations

Before running the program, you need to install the following packages:

```sh
pip install opencv-python
pip install pytesseract
```sh

Additionally, you need to download and install the Tesseract-OCR executable. You can download it from this link-https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
